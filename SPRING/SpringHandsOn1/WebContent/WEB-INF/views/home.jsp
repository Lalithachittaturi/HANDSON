Entertainment is a form of activity that holds the attention and 
interest of an audience or gives pleasure and delight. 
It can be an idea or a task, but is more likely to be one of the 
activities or events that have developed over thousands of years 
specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention.</p>
